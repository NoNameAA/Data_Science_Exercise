1.
(1). The reddit-0 data set and effectively no work: 
real	0m8.132s

(2). No schema specified and not caching(reddit-2):
real	0m16.274s

(3). With a schema but not caching(reddit-2):
real	0m12.713s

(4). With both a schema and caching the twice-used DataFrame(reddit-2):
real	0m10.759s


2. The most of time is used for reading the files.

3. I used .cache() between filter the data by some conditions and groupBy('datetime').max('view').
